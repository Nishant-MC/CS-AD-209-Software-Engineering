CS-AD-209-Software-Engineering
==============================

Repository that contains the source code for Jin U Bak & Nishant MC's  Software Engineering assignments.

Currently in this repo: Group Project 1 - Emirates DLD

We have implemented DLD agents.

We have also attempted extra credit. This can be found in receptionist class. One can choose queuing algorithm when 
initializing receptionist.

To run the code, run from main_run.py with a function named run() that takes a list of tuples of arrival time and customer.
