The Murky World of Politics
Succeeding politically requires two things: luck and opacity.
	It requires the right place, the right people and the right time,
But even more important is the incredible audacity
	To omit, to sell half-truth, to claim virtue in some crime.
If people can see right through you,
	And observe what you really are,
Bid all your schemes and plans adieu,
	As you aren’t likely to go very far.
What a shame, since those who can be expected
	To work for a common good are all open books!
Transparency can lead but can’t get elected 
	And so power remains in the hands of crooks.
