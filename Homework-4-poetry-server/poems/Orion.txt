Orion and Merope
“There can be no half-measures, nor compromise
In your integrity: all who contest this live lowly lies
Their petty, pretentious possessions a pauper’s prize,
	A hollow, hedonistic facade; a rich man’s disguise
	An attempt to hide the constant cries, the desperate tries 
	To fill existence with meaning before ignominious demise.”
Elegant words from an elegant lady: the Queen of Blades,
Sitting atop her high horse, attended by her courtly maids,
Dictating an imperious speech to her scribes, the Pleiades.
	The youngest scribe, a little girl named Merope, frowned.
	“Is the world really so black and white? You were crowned
	On the basis of rousing rhetoric; those words surely sound
Most learned and sage, yet at the same time, I am afraid.
I can’t help but feel something’s missing… A shade of grey, unportrayed,
An absent acknowledgement that unravels a great masquerade...”
	The Queen’s eyes flashed. Who was this upstart whelp
	Who dared to butt in and offer most unwanted help?
	“SILENCE!” she yelled, eliciting a frightened yelp.
Her husband, Orion, had been watching from afar.
A slow grin crossed his face; his eyes twinkled, like a star
At the precocious young scribe. “How very bizarre
	To see such awareness mixed up with a careless
	Disregard for one’s bodily safety!”
